# 🌍 Decentralized Supply Chain Provenance

Welcome to a transparent, blockchain-based solution for tracking goods across the supply chain! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project ensures authenticity, traceability, and trust for products like pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, or organic produce.

## ✨ Features
🔍 **Immutable Provenance**: Track a product’s journey from origin to consumer.  
📜 **Certifications**: Verify certifications (e.g., organic, fair trade) on-chain.  
📦 **Batch Management**: Register and track product batches.  
🔄 **Ownership Transfers**: Record and verify changes in product custody.  
✅ **Public Verification**: Allow anyone to verify product authenticity.  
🚫 **Fraud Prevention**: Prevent tampering or duplicate registrations.

## 🛠 How It Works

### For Producers
1. **Register a Product**: Use the `product-registry` contract to register a product with a unique ID, name, and origin details.
2. **Add Certifications**: Use the `certification-manager` contract to attach certifications (e.g., organic, FDA-approved) with issuer signatures.
3. **Create Batches**: Use the `batch-tracker` contract to register batches with details like production date and quantity.
4. **Log Events**: Record supply chain events (e.g., manufacturing, shipping) using the `event-logger` contract.

### For Supply Chain Participants
1. **Transfer Ownership**: Use the `ownership-transfer` contract to record custody changes (e.g., from manufacturer to distributor).
2. **Update Events**: Log handling conditions (e.g., temperature, location) to ensure compliance.

### For Consumers/Regulators
1. **Verify Provenance**: Use the `provenance-verifier` contract to check a product’s origin, certifications, and supply chain history.
2. **Audit Trail**: Access immutable logs to confirm authenticity and handling.
